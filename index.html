            <p>Hi, I'm Ezra-Shimon Rosenfeld!  I'm a computer science major at Yeshiva University, and I'm graduating in January of 2017.</p>
            
            <p>I fell in love with computer programming during my intro course in my first semester of college.  I gained invaluable insights from my professor, Van Kelly, who told inspiring tales about working at Bell Labs in the 80's and who taught me good habits like refactoring, top-down development, and unit testing.  I became a tutor around the time of my first midterm, and I've been tutoring ever since.</p>
            
            <p>I never really understood what life was like before GUIs until my software engineering internship at Textron Systems in Baltimore last summer.  I got pretty comfortable with the Linux Command line, and I learned how to use vi.  Most of my work involved writing programs in two languages I hadn't even heard of before my internship: Bash and Powershell.  I also worked closely with a co-intern and learned a lot about collaboration including source control and how to merge files together.</p>
            
            <p>This past school year, I took a couple classes that taught me how to create practical applications.  I took a web development class in which I learned HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and Bootstrap.  In that class, I learned a lot of good web development habits, like separating content from style, and making sure my websites are accessible to all users by including <code>lang="en"</code> in my <code>html</code> tag and including the <code>alt</code> attribute in all of my images.</p>
            
            <p>I've had a lot of stuff thrown at me this past year.  I've had to learn a lot of different technologies in a short amount of time, and now, I'm really looking forward to using those skills to work on some projects.  I fell in love with agile development during my Industrial Software Engineering course last semester, and I would really like to work on an agile team, but until then, feel free to contact me for all of your freelance web development needs!</p>
